# Bregman first-order methods
This repository hosts an implementation of first-order methods for optimization over the cone of nonnegative trigonometric matrix polynomials $K$ given by

$$
K = {(X_0, X_1, \dots, X_p)  |  X_0 + \sum_{k=1}^p (X_k z^k + X_k z^{-k}) },
$$

where the matrices $X_0 \in \mathbb{S}^m$ and $X_k \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times m}$, $1 \leq k \leq p$ are variables in the optimization problem. For details and applications
of this type of optimization problem, we refer to our manuscript XXX.
